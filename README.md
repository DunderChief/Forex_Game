This is a simple trading game where you try to see how much you can make in 1 week using only technical analysis. For now this can be useful in getting a *feel* for manual trading, or just a fun game to play.

The ultimate goal is to do an experiment to see if I can perform better by **listening** to price action rather than a candlestick chart. Where returns are converted to a sound whose frequency indicates positive/negative return, and amplitude signifies the magnitude of return.
