This is a simple trading game where you see how much you can make in 1 week using only technical analysis. For now this can be useful in getting a feel for manual trading, finding novel buying patterns, or just a fun game to play.

The ultimate goal is to do an experiment to see if I can perform better by *listening* to price action rather than *viewing* a candlestick chart. Where returns are converted to a sound whose frequency indicates positive/negative return, and amplitude signifies the magnitude of return. My hypothesis is that humans are better suited to detect time series patterns through hearing. For instance looking at a graph of someone saying 'Hello' is indistinguishable to any other word.
